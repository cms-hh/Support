In "Hist2DSum_V0_SM_box.root" you find the distribution for both 
     - the SM point (simulated from 100k events) - H0binX  
     - sum of the events simulated to Moriond 2016 (SM + box + the V0 benchmarks from 2-13 (simulated from ~300k events/each) - H1binX  

where X = 1 means the binning ( 90,0.,1800.,10,-1,1. ) and X = 1 means the same binning used for the analytical formula (see bellow)

     binGenMHH = [250.,270.,300.,330.,360.,390., 420.,450.,500.,550.,600.,700.,800.,1000.] 
     binGenCostS  = [ -1., -0.55,0.55,1.  ]

In "Distros_5p_SM3M_sumBenchJHEP_13TeV.root" you find the distribution for both 
     - the SM point (simulated from 3M events) - H0binX  
     - sum of the events from simulation of the 12 benchmarks defined in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02245v4.pdf (JHEP version) - H1binX
